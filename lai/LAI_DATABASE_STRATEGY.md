## Purpose

This document records all known free LAI data sources, their suitability for the GPRI plugin suite, and the strategy for building a curated, defensible LAI plant library for GPR calculation.

The LAI database is the intellectual core of GPRI. The delivery mechanism is a suite of lightweight plugins (GPR+AutoCAD, GPR+Revit, GPR+Rhino, GPR+Vectorworks) that implement the GPRSELECT workflow â€” no geometry generation, just species lookup and GPR calculation. A scientifically rigorous, auditable, urban-context LAI database — the first of its kind — is the publishable IP.

---

## The Central Scientific Problem

All existing LAI databases were compiled for ecological and forestry research. Values were measured in natural forests, plantations, and experimental plots — not urban conditions. Urban greenery is fundamentally different:

- Root volume restriction → reduced LAI vs open-ground
- Substrate depth constraints (green roofs, podium gardens)
- Light level variation (street tree shade, atrium interiors, aspect)
- Wind exposure on rooftops
- Irrigation regimes and soil quality
- Pruning management

**The GPRI plugin suite must ultimately provide:**
1. A best-available LAI value per species (from literature)
2. An urban adjustment factor per installation type — OR — direct urban-measured LAI where data exists
3. Full traceability: source, methodology, context

---

## LAI Variability by Context — The Fundamental Challenge

### Why LAI values vary so widely

LAI is not a fixed property of a species. It is a dynamic response to growing conditions. The same species measured in different contexts can yield LAI values that differ by a factor of 2–10. This is not measurement error — it is ecophysiological reality.

The Singapore field data (Boon & Tan 2009) makes this starkly visible. Comparing Singapore urban field measurements against TRY database values (open/natural context):

| Species | TRY mean | Singapore field | Ratio | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-------|-------|
| *Acer spicatum* | 1.34 | 6.91 | 5.2× | TRY measured in shade; Singapore in open tropical urban |
| *Cirsium arvense* | 4.76 | 6.62 | 1.4× | Similar context |
| *Deschampsia cespitosa* | 3.08 | 4.52 | 1.5× | Singapore warmer climate drives higher LAI |
| *Cornus stolonifera* | 0.05 | 0.23 | 4.6× | TRY has many drought/dormancy measurements dragging mean |
| *Caryocar brasiliense* | 1.48 | 2.36 | 1.6× | Savanna vs urban tropical |

The extreme cases (*Acer spicatum* 5×, *Cornus stolonifera* 4.6×) illustrate that using the wrong source value can produce a GPR result that is off by nearly an order of magnitude for a single surface.

### Primary context variables driving LAI variation

**1. Climate zone**  
Tropical humid climates sustain higher LAI year-round than temperate climates with seasonal deciduous loss. A temperate deciduous tree measured in winter vs a tropical evergreen are not comparable. TRY and ORNL databases aggregate across all seasons and climates — the mean hides this.

| Climate zone | Typical LAI range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tropical humid (year-round) | 3–10 | Continuous growing season; high LAI |
| Subtropical (wet/dry) | 2–8 | Dry season reduction |
| Temperate (seasonal) | 1–7 | Deciduous species: near 0 in winter |
| Mediterranean (summer dry) | 1–5 | Drought-adapted; summer reduction |
| Arid/semi-arid | 0.2–3 | Extreme reduction; succulents low |

**2. Urban vs rural vs natural context**  
Urban environments impose multiple simultaneous constraints. The net effect is highly species- and installation-specific:

| Factor | Effect on LAI | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| Root restriction (pit, planter) | Reduced canopy size | ↓ LAI |
| Substrate depth < 400mm | Reduced root volume, stress | ↓ LAI |
| Elevated CO₂ (urban air) | Slight photosynthetic increase | ↑ LAI |
| Urban heat island | Extended growing season | ↑ LAI (temperate) |
| Light reduction (overshadowing) | Reduced photosynthesis | ↓ LAI |
| Irrigation supplementation | Reduced drought stress | ↑ LAI |
| Pollution / compaction | Stress response | ↓ LAI |
| Regular pruning | Reduced canopy density | ↓ LAI |

Net effect: urban LAI is typically 30–60% lower than open-ground LAI for the same species under the same climate. Some species show the opposite (street trees in warm irrigated climates can perform similarly to natural growth).

**3. Installation type**  
This is the most actionable variable for a planning tool because it is specified by the designer:

| Installation type | Substrate / root volume | Typical LAI adjustment | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ground planting, deep soil (>1m) | Unlimited | 0.85–1.0 × open-ground | Medium |
| Ground planting, raised bed (600mm–1m) | Moderate | 0.70–0.90 | Low |
| Podium garden (400–600mm substrate) | Restricted | 0.55–0.75 | Low |
| Extensive green roof (<150mm) | Highly restricted | 0.30–0.55 | Low |
| Intensive green roof (150–400mm) | Restricted | 0.45–0.70 | Low |
| Street tree pit (standard) | Very restricted | 0.40–0.65 | Low |
| Street tree pit (structural soil) | Moderate | 0.60–0.80 | Low |
| Vertical greenery, soil-based | Wall-mounted, limited | 0.55–0.80 | Very low |
| Vertical greenery, hydroponic | No substrate limit | 0.70–0.90 | Very low |
| Atrium planting | Reduced light | 0.40–0.70 | Very low |

*Confidence reflects availability of measured data, not theoretical understanding.*

**4. Light availability**  
LAI is directly regulated by light. Shade-adapted species develop high LAI at low light; sun-adapted species may have low LAI but high photosynthetic efficiency per unit area. This matters for:
- North-facing walls (southern hemisphere) — significantly lower light
- Atrium and podium gardens with overshadowing
- Street tree pits under building canopies
- Understorey planting in multi-layered schemes

**5. Measurement methodology**  
Different measurement methods produce systematically different LAI values:

| Method | Typical bias | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Destructive harvest (gold standard) | None | Labour-intensive; not practical at scale |
| LAI-2000 / Plant Canopy Analyser | Slight underestimate | Most common; Boon & Tan 2009 method |
| Hemispherical photography | Underestimate 10–30% | Clumping correction required |
| Litter traps | Seasonal; one-sided area | Standard for forests |
| MODIS/remote sensing | Landscape-scale; urban artefacts | Not species-level |

The TRY database aggregates across all methods without systematic correction. This adds methodological noise to the already large contextual variance.

### What this means for the GPRI plugin suite

**Immediate position (MVP):**
- Use best-available LAI value from the highest-confidence source (Singapore field > ORNL/TRY)
- Display source provenance for every value in the UI
- Flag ORNL/TRY values with a caution note: *"Measured in open/natural conditions. Urban LAI may be lower. Urban calibration pending."*
- Do not fabricate urban adjustment factors without measured data to support them

**Near-term database work:**
- Add `context_notes` field to the database recording known variation (e.g. *"TRY mean includes shade-grown values; Singapore field measured in open tropical urban"*)
- Add `measurement_method` field where known
- Add `climate_zone_of_measurement` field
- Record `min_lai` and `max_lai` from TRY — the range is as informative as the mean

**Long-term research programme (substantial funding required):**
This is a research programme, not a development task. It requires:
- Systematic field LAI measurement campaigns across climate zones (Perth, Singapore, Hong Kong, a temperate European city)
- Controlled experiments varying substrate depth, light level, and installation type
- A peer-reviewed publication establishing the urban LAI adjustment framework
- Funding order of magnitude: AUD 500K–2M for a rigorous multi-city programme

Until that data exists, the GPRI plugin suite's LAI values carry an honest uncertainty that must be communicated to users — not hidden. The Singapore field data is the only directly urban-measured source we currently have. It covers 35 species. Everything else is an informed estimate.

### Database notation standard

Every LAI entry in the database should carry sufficient metadata for a user or reviewer to assess its fitness for a given application. The minimum required fields are:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mean_lai` | Best-estimate value for calculation |
| `min_lai` / `max_lai` | Known range — communicates uncertainty |
| `measurement_count` | Sample size — low n = low confidence |
| `sources` | Primary source(s) |
| `urban_context` | Boolean — was this measured in an urban setting? |
| `singapore_field_lai` | Singapore urban field value if available (Boon & Tan 2009) |
| `context_notes` | Free text — known sources of variation, climate of measurement, method |
| `confidence_tier` | 1 = urban field measured; 2 = open-ground measured; 3 = literature estimate |

**Confidence tier definition:**
- **Tier 1** — directly measured in urban conditions (Singapore field data; future urban campaigns)
- **Tier 2** — measured in open/natural conditions; reasonable proxy with disclosed uncertainty
- **Tier 3** — estimated from literature, manufacturer data, or expert judgement; use with caution

Currently in the GPRI Global Plant Database:
- Tier 1: 35 species (Singapore field, Boon & Tan 2009)
- Tier 2: ~725 species (ORNL/TRY)
- Tier 3: 0 (not yet added)

The free-tier `plants_free.json` already implements provenance badges (Field / ORNL / Lit) as a user-facing representation of this tier system.

## Strategies

### Strategy A — Curated Species Library (MVP)
Build a hand-curated list of 50–100 species most relevant to Perth and Singapore urban greenery contexts. Source LAI from ORNL/TRY where available; supplement with Tan & Sia 2009 values; add urban adjustment factors based on installation type (conservative estimates until measured data available). This is the GPRI plugin v1.0 material library.

**Output:** `Material Library.csv` (already started)  
**Timeline:** Doable now with existing data  
**Risk:** Urban adjustment factors are expert estimates, not measured — must be disclosed

### Strategy B — Full Database Expansion
Systematically pull from AusTraits, NParks, and peer-reviewed urban LAI literature to expand species coverage and add measured urban LAI values where they exist. Cross-reference all entries with ORNL/TRY for consistency.

**Output:** Expanded `LAI_combined_clean.csv` with `urban_lai`, `urban_context`, `substrate_depth`, `light_level` fields  
**Timeline:** Months; suitable for Mobius Factory automation  
**Risk:** Labour-intensive; some sources incomplete

### Strategy C — Mobius Factory Autonomous Crawl
Configure a Mobius Factory module (`Urban Greenery & LAI`) to continuously crawl peer-reviewed urban LAI literature, Singapore/HK/EU technical guidelines, and manufacturer plant data. Evaluated findings enter a Supabase knowledge layer; the plugin suite pulls from it periodically.

**Output:** Self-improving, citable urban LAI knowledge base  
**Timeline:** Medium-term; requires Factory module build  
**Risk:** Data quality depends on Factory evaluation prompts

## Recommended Next Steps (in order)

1. **Boon:** Manually categorise 55 REVIEW species in `LAI_categorised.csv`
2. **Boon:** Annotate `LAI_tropical_subset.csv` — mark species relevant to Perth/Singapore
3. **Extract Tan & Sia 2009** — species list and LAI values → add to combined database with `source = "Tan_Sia_2009"` and `urban_context = TRUE`
4. **Assess AusTraits** — download trait data, check LAI/SLA coverage for Australian species
5. **Build curated Material Library** — 50–100 species, Strategy A, ready for GPRI plugin v1.0
6. **Define urban adjustment factor schema** — installation type × substrate depth × light level → LAI multiplier
7. **Strategy B/C** — post-MVP, expand with Factory integration

For each species entry in the final material library:

| Field | Values | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `species_name` | binomial | |

## Session 2026-05-28 — Coding Standard: Long-Running Script Progress

### Rule: Every long-running Python script must have live in-place progress.

Any script that iterates over many rows, files, or API calls — and takes more
than a few seconds — must implement the following pattern. No exceptions.

**Requirements:**
- Update in place using `\r` (carriage return) — NEVER scroll with `print()`
- Print every 10 rows (not every batch, not every 100, not on finish only)
- Include on every update line:
    - Progress bar  `[####----------------]`
    - Percentage    `42%`
    - Counter       `done/total`
    - Elapsed time  `2m14s`
    - ETA           `eta 1m30s`
    - Current item  (species name, filename, etc.)
- Final `\n` after the loop so the cursor drops to a new line
- Summary on finish: total processed, success count, time taken

**Template:**
```python
PRINT_EVERY = 10

def progress(done, total, t0, label=""):
    elapsed = time.time() - t0
    rate    = done / elapsed if elapsed > 0 else 1
    eta     = (total - done) / rate if rate > 0 else 0
    pct     = int(done / total * 100) if total else 0
    bar     = "#" * (pct // 5) + "-" * (20 - pct // 5)
    lbl     = (label[:28] + "..") if len(label) > 30 else label.ljust(30)
    print(f"\r  [{bar}] {pct:>3}%  {done:>6}/{total}  "
          f"{int(elapsed//60)}m{int(elapsed%60):02d}s  eta {int(eta//60)}m{int(eta%60):02d}s  {lbl}",
          end="", flush=True)

for i, item in enumerate(items, 1):
    # ... process item ...
    if i % PRINT_EVERY == 0 or i == len(items):
        progress(i, len(items), t0, item.name)
print()  # final newline
```

**Applies to:** enrich_usda_traits.py, enrich_images.py, enrich_carbon.py,
enrich_koppen.py, enrich_gbif.py, upload_to_supabase.py, and ALL future
enrichment, processing, or upload scripts.

**Rationale:** Boon cannot tell if a script is running, stuck, or crashed
without live feedback. "Updating 9,238 rows..." with nothing for 185 minutes
is unacceptable. Every 10 rows means feedback within seconds at all reasonable
processing speeds.

### ADDENDUM: Line width is critical

The `\r` carriage return only works if the progress line fits within the
terminal width. If the line wraps to a second visual line, `\r` goes to
the start of that second line -- not the start of the progress line --
causing every update to scroll.

**Rule: Always cap and pad the progress line to exactly 76 characters.**

```python
line = f"  [{bar}] {pct:>3}%  {done}/{total}  {elapsed_str}  eta {eta_str}  {label}"
print("\r" + line[:76].ljust(76), end="", flush=True)
```

The `.ljust(76)` pads short lines with spaces to clear any leftover content
from a previous longer update. The `[:76]` ensures it never wraps.
Truncate the label (species name, filename) to fit -- it is cosmetic only.
